# express-js-template
Template to quickly spin-up ExpressJS (Node JS) app for my projects, based on stack that was taught in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s ["Full Stack JavaScript" course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript), as of 2025.

- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- PostgreSQL as database (with `node-postgres` (`pg`))
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) for templating

There is also
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code formatting, and [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook?tab=readme-ov-file) to automate running it on every commit
